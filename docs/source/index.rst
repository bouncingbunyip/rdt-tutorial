Bunyip FormBuilder!
===================================

**BunyipFormBuilder** is a PHP library for building HTML forms.
This library is designed to be used as a 'stand-alone' library, not part of any specific framework.  This library also does not require Composer.
I have designed it to be as *simple* and *intuitive* as possible.

Check out the :doc:`examples` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
